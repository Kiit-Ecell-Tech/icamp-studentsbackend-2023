# Before you start

1) Sample of all the REST routes can be viewed in student.rest file
2) try-catch block is not required due to the library express-async-error
3) POST req uses promise chaining due to email (try-catch) would be hectic
4) put (update) routes is not required hence a basic boilerplate has been put
5) Fill in the env values before deploying to production
6) Student Names and roll are validated on uniqueness and required
7) Mongo DB has been used
8) Mail template can be found in theme.html

In case of any doubt ping me personally: Pratik
